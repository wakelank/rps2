I addd a shoot button and function to grab the players moves and evalutate a game.
looks like it's keeping scores, thought it's not posting them to the screen.  I changed the classes in the html from "score" to
"scoreA" and "scoreB" to make that easier.  Also, I made a Game.prototype.showScore function that is supposed to write
the scores to the divs, but it's not working.

If you want to take what I did and run with it, cool.  If you want to continue with your repo, also cool.

Also, the game is supposed to not allow a move unless a new game has been stared, and it's supposed to end the game 
once a player wins three in a row.  I haven't done anything with this.
